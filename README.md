A simple Solidity smart contract that stores a public message on-chain.
# MessageBoard Smart Contract

## Overview
MessageBoard is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that allows the contract owner to store and update a message on the blockchain. It demonstrates basic Solidity concepts including constructors, state variables, access control, and public getters.

## Features
- Store a string message on-chain.
- Owner-only permission to update the message.
- Publicly accessible message via an auto-generated getter.

## Usage
1. Deploy the contract on the Sepolia testnet using Remix or your preferred tool.
2. Provide the initial message as a constructor argument.
3. Use the `message` public variable to read the current message.
4. The contract owner can call `updateMessage` to change the message.
